# Wildfire-Detection-using-Convolution-Neural-Network-TensorFlow-

Wildfire is a davastating problem in California due to climate change. Last year, in 2021, there were 185 wildfires in California. Wildfires are usually detected by satellite and camera towel images. Human looking at these images causes fatiuge and error.

In this project, I downloaded fire and nonfire images from the internet, and built a convolution neural network by transfer learning with the pretrained Xception model to classify if an image shows there is or there is no wildfire.
